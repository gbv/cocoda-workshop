## Abstract

During the last years we developed the [web application Cocoda](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/) for creating and managing mappings between library classification schemes, authority files, knowledge graphs, and similar knowledge organization systems. The workshop will introduce you to the technical background of Cocoda and vocabulary mappings. You will learn how to set up and configure your own instance of Cocoda and related services, and how to integrate additional vocabularies. We will explore the [JSKOS data format](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/jskos.html) and APIs, discuss integration of additional data sources and brainstorm about quality assurance and usability.

The participants are required to bring their own computer with NodeJS (at least version 8), git, and basic practical knowledge of processing JSON files. Participants are encouraged to bring their own vocabularies, mappings, and/or data sources
